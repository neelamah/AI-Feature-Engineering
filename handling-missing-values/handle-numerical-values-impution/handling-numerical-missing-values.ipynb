    "disadvantage:- \n",
    "1. shape of distribution change\n",
    "2. changes in covarience and corelation\n",
    "3. some more outlier comes.\n",

    "when to use:-\n",
    "1. when data missing randomly.\n",

    "after apply what need to check:-\n",
    "1. varience:-we need to check varience(how much deviated from means. varience always shrin when apply mean , median. But it should not shrink to much like orional variance:- 200, after aply mena/mediena variance is= 161)\n",
    "3. distributiom:- distribution of data should not chane to much.\n",
    "4. covarience:- it should not change more.\n",
    "5. corelation:- it should not change more.\n",
    "6. boxplot:- we shlould draw and check boxplot. is there any new outliers added."
